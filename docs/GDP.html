<h1> How changes in tariffs affect GDP </h1>

<h2> Latin America Countries </h2>

<p>Taking a quick look at the effect of tariffs on the change in GDP-per-capita growth rate, we see that a slight
negative trend is observed. However, there is heavy clustering of observations around the middle - i.e. points
where there is both little change in GDP growth rate and tariff changes.
A regression (see below) of changes in growth rates on tariffs showed no significant results.

<p>
Applying the same approach to sub categories of tariff changes, we found very similar results.
Overall, there was a large clustering of observations where changes in both GDP growth rate and tariffs were static.
There were slightly negative relationships between changes in GDP growth rate and all tariff categories, except for raw materials.
However, our regression found that there is no significant relationship. In fact, as a whole, the low r-squares implied that tariff
changes had very little association with GDP growth rates.
</p>

<p>
  The effects of tariff changes may have been biased downwards, given the substantial clustering of observations around near-zero
  changes for both GDP growth and tariffs. Therefore, we extended the analysis to consider the effect of larger changes in tariffs and
  if they are related to more significant changes in growth rate.
  To do so, we categorized tariffs and growth rates into 3 buckets - increases, decreases and same.

<p>
  We can see that decreases in tariffs are associated with cases of increased growth rates and vice versa.
  This inverse relationship also appears to be stronger for tariff decreases than increases.

<h2> G7 Countries </h2>

<p>
  Repeating the process for G7 countries, we found a similarly weak and negative relationship between tariffs and GDP growth.

<p>
  From the graph above, we can see that the effects are consistent with those for LatAm countries, and possibly more pronounced.
  An interesting observation: if tariffs were kept at relatively constant levels, the likelihood of slowing growth is higher for G7
  countries vis-a-vis LatAm.
</p>
<h2> Conclusion </h2>
<p>
  Although we did not observe any significant relationship between tariff changes and GDP growth rates, there was a broad trend across
  both LatAm and G7 countries that reducing tariffs is more likely to improve GDP growth rates. However, this exercise reminds us that
  GDP growth is driven by more factors than tariffs alone. Policy makers seeking to improve a country's welfare would be wise to look
  beyond tariffs, and consider other factors such as productivity.
