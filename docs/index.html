<h1> Changes in tariffs </h1>

<p>
  Tariffs and the protection of domestic products have been topic of discussion for a long time and have been back to the spotlight after last election.
  The topic was brought back by Donald Trump and with renewed media attention some questions arrise, like how does this contribute to differences among countries?
  We will try to answer this by comparing changes in tariffs among developed and developing countries.

</p>

<p>
  Using yearly (1996 - 2016) data from the <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/">World Bank</a> and <a href="https://wits.worldbank.org/">World Integrated Trade Solution</a>,
  we conducted an analysis of the relationship between tariff changes and the economy. The table below sets out the definition of the variables used:
</p>
  
    <table>
    <tr><th>Dependent Variables</th>         <th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>GDP per Capita Growth Rate</td>          <td class=trcell> Year-on-year rate of change of GDP per capita</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Unemployment Rate</td>       <td class=trcell>Unemployed persons as percentage of total labor force</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Labor Force Participation Rate</td>     <td class=trcell>Sum of employed and unemployed persons as a percentage of total population aged 15+</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Inflation Rate</td>   <td class=trcell>Year-on-year increase in consumer prices (%)</td></tr>

    </table>

    <table>
    <tr><th>Independent Variables</th>         <th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>All Products</td>          <td class=trcell> .. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Intermediate Goods</td>       <td class=trcell> .. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Capital Goods</td>     <td class=trcell> .. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Consumer Goods</td>   <td class=trcell> .. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Raw Materials</td>   <td class=trcell> .. </td></tr> 

    </table>

  <h2> Methodology </h2>
  <br>
  As this is a panel dataset, we took first differences to compute the delta and percentage change.  We used delta for GDP per Capita Growth rate changes, and percentage changes for the others,
  including tariff changes.  As the impact of tariff changes are unlikely to be felt immediately, we compared T0 tariff changes to T+2 economic changes.  
  <br>
  Our findings are presented in the subsequent pages.
