<h1> Changes in tariffs </h1>

<p>
  Trade has often being used as a whipping boy for loss of jobs and economic suffering, as displaced workers are unable to find new jobs and
  wind up sinking into economic depression. The following analysis has as its main objective to better understand the consequences of trade policies
on the overall welfare of a country, more specifically comparing the economic effects faced by
developed and developing countries.


</p>
<h2> Countries </h2>


<p>The countries chosen to represent developed countries are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom and United States (green color in the map).
</p>

<p>
The countries chosen to represent developing countries are Aruba, Argentina, Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Barbados, Chile, Colombia,
Costa Rica, Cuba, Cura√ßao, Cayman Islands, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Grenada, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Haiti, Jamaica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Martin, Sint Maarten(France)*, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama South America, Peru South America, Puerto Rico, Paraguay, El Salvador, Suriname, Turks and Caicos Islands, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Venezuela, Virgin Islands (U.S.)* and British Virgin Islands (red color in the map).

   because of the overlap with USA and France.</small>

<h2> Tariffs </h2>
<p>
  Using yearly (1996 - 2016) data from the <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/">World Bank</a> and <a href="https://wits.worldbank.org/">World Integrated Trade Solution</a>,
  we conducted an analysis of the relationship between tariff changes and the economy. The table below sets out the definition of the variables used:
</p>

    <table>
    <tr><th>Dependent Variables</th>         <th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>GDP per Capita Growth Rate</td>          <td class=trcell> Year-on-year rate of change of GDP per capita</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Unemployment Rate</td>       <td class=trcell>Unemployed persons as percentage of total labor force</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Labor Force Participation Rate</td>     <td class=trcell>Sum of employed and unemployed persons as a percentage of total population aged 15+</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Inflation Rate</td>   <td class=trcell>Year-on-year increase in consumer prices (%)</td></tr>

    </table>
    <br>

    <table>
    <tr><th>Independent Variables</th>         <th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>All Products</td>          <td class=trcell> Year Average tariff for all products in WITS' database </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Intermediate Goods</td>       <td class=trcell> Year Average tariff for a group of intermediate goods as defined by HS Standard Product Groups**</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Capital Goods</td>     <td class=trcell> Year Average tariff for a group of intermediate goods as defined by HS Standard Product Groups** </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Consumer Goods</td>   <td class=trcell> Year Average tariff for a group of intermediate goods as defined by HS Standard Product Groups** </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Raw Materials</td>   <td class=trcell> Year Average tariff for a group of intermediate goods as defined by HS Standard Product Groups** </td></tr>

  <h2> Methodology </h2>
  <p>
    As this is a panel dataset, we took first differences to compute the delta and percentage change.  We used delta for GDP per Capita Growth rate changes, and percentage changes for the others,
  including tariff changes.  As the impact of tariff changes are unlikely to be felt immediately, we compared T0 tariff changes to T+2 economic changes.

    Our findings are presented in the subsequent pages.
