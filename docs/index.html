<h1> Changes in tariffs </h1>

<p>
  Trade has often being used as a whipping boy for loss of jobs and economic suffering, as displaced workers are unable to find new jobs and
  wind up sinking into economic depression. The following analysis has as its main objective to better understand the consequences of trade policies
on the overall welfare of a country, more specifically comparing the economic effects faced by
developed and developing countries.

</p>
<h2> Overall Conclusion </h2>

  <p>
Although we could not find evidence that tariffs (and in turn, freer trade) had an effect on economic welfare in developed or developing countries, there remains an important message - Imposing tariffs do not improve welfare either.
Politicians campaign on increased tariffs to protect jobs, a soothing message to their constituents. However, whilst tariffs may improve the lives of that small group whose jobs are protected, the larger population may not benefit as a result.
Voters should be skeptical about pushes to increase tariffs, and instead ask, what can be done to ensure that people adversely affected by trade openness are compensated in one way or another.

<h2> Tariffs </h2>
<p>
  Using yearly (1996 - 2016) data from the <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/">World Bank</a> and <a href="https://wits.worldbank.org/">World Integrated Trade Solution</a>,
  we conducted an analysis of the relationship between tariff changes and the economy. The table below sets out the definition of the variables used:
</p>

    <table>
    <tr><th>Dependent Variables</th>         <th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>GDP per Capita Growth Rate</td>          <td class=trcell> Year-on-year rate of change of GDP per capita</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Unemployment Rate</td>       <td class=trcell>Unemployed persons as percentage of total labor force</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Labor Force Participation Rate**</td>     <td class=trcell>Sum of employed and unemployed persons as a percentage of total population aged 15+</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Inflation Rate</td>   <td class=trcell>Year-on-year increase in consumer prices (%)</td></tr>

  <h2> Methodology </h2>
  <p>
    As this is a panel dataset, we took first differences to compute the delta and percentage change.  We used delta for GDP per Capita Growth rate changes, and percentage changes for the others,
  including tariff changes.  As the impact of tariff changes are unlikely to be felt immediately, we compared T0 tariff changes to T+2 economic changes.

    Our findings are presented in the subsequent pages.
