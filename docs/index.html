<h1> Changes in tariffs </h1>

<p>
  Tariffs and the protection of domestic products have been topic of discussion for a long time and have been back to the spotlight after last election.
  The topic was brought back by Donald Trump and with renewed media attention some questions arrise, like how does this contribute to differences among countries?
  We will try to answer this by comparing changes in tariffs among developed and developing countries.

<p>
  Using data from the <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/">World Bank</a> and <a href="https://wits.worldbank.org/">World Integrated Trade Solution</a>,
  we conducted an analysis of the relationship between tariff changes and the economy. The table below sets out the definition of the variables used:
</p>
  
    <table>
    <tr><th>Dependent Variables</th>         <th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>GDP per Capita Growth Rate</td>          <td class=trcell> Year-on-year rate of change of GDP per capita</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Unemployment Rate</td>       <td class=trcell>Unemployed persons as percentage of total labor force</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Labor Force Participation Rate</td>     <td class=trcell>Sum of employed and unemployed persons as a percentage of total population aged 15+</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Inflation Rate</td>   <td class=trcell>Year-on-year increase in consumer prices (%)</td></tr>

    </table>
